ssh-proxy = "Proxying SSH over HTTPS

Wrapping SSH in HTTPS makes it accessible anywhere and also makes it routable.
Whether inside a harsh network environment or even if hindered by a poorly
configured firewall, once wrapped in tls, ssh becomes UNSTOPPABLE.

Usage:
        telebit ssh <remote> [ssh flags and options]

Example:

        telebit ssh jon.telebit.io

It is NOT at all neccessary to use \"telebit ssh\", it's just a convenience.
Wanna know why, and the alternatives? Keep reading!

## History

When TLS sends an encrypted packet over the network it begins with a handshake
which shows the things like the tls version and the host SERVERNAME unencrypted
so that the remote server can respond with the correct certificate.

SSH was created well before TLS and has a completely different header. The good
news is that, unlike some other early internet protocols, it does have a header
with its name and version, but it doesn't have anything to identify the server.

##  Telebit + SSH

Here's why:

When you're running ssh through an https tunnel (as telebit does) you
can't just use \"ssh me.example.com\" to get in. You have to tell ssh that you
want to use an https tunnel. Using \"telebit ssh\" as a client will specify
all of the correct ssh options.

However, when you want to connect to ssh over https, you either have to pass
the correct arguments or modify your ~/.ssh/config to use \"openssl s_client\".

We explain the different configurations below:

## SSH + openssl

The configuration that's most likely to work with what's already installed on
your machine is this:

        Host jon.telebit.io
          ProxyCommand openssl s_client -quiet -connect %h:443 -servername %h

Or you would call ssh directly, like this:

        ssh jon.telebit.io -o ProxyCommand=\"openssl s_client -quiet -connect %h:443 -servername %h\"

It's rather simple, but it looks quite daunting.

## SSH + sclient

Because that looks a little hairy, we created \"sclient\", so that the example
could look a bit more digestible:

        Host jon.telebit.io
          ProxyCommand sclient %h

Or

        ssh jon.telebit.io -o ProxyCommand=\"sclient %h\"

## Inverse SSH Tunnel (same as stunnel)

The commands above instruct ssh to open a pipe into openssl or sclient. If we
instead want to connect ssh to a local tunnel, it looks like this:

        Host jon.telebit.io
          Hostname localhost
          Port 3000
          HostKeyAlias jon.telebit.io
          CheckHostIP no
          RequestTTY force

Or

        ssh localhost -p 3000 -t -o CheckHostIP=no -o HostKeyAlias=jon.telebit.io

tcp = "Telebit TCP - Seemless connectivity to LEGACY apps.
Use 'telebit http' instead, where possible (including for ssh).

usage: telebit tcp <path/port/none>

        tcp <local> [remote]          forward tcp to <local> from <remote>
        ex: telebit tcp 5050 6565     ex: forward tcp port 6565 locally to port 5050

        tcp <path> [remote]           show ftp-style directory listing
        ex: telebit tcp ~/Public      ex: show listing of ~/Public

        tcp none [remote]             disable tcp access for [remote] port
        ex: telebit tcp none 6565     ex: remove access to port 6565

Use cases:

        Debugging plain TCP when troubleshooting a legacy app
        You can't install a secure client (like telebit, sclient, openssl, or stunnel)
