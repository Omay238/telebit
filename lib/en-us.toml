http = "usage: telebit http <path/port/none> [subdomain]

'telebit http' is the fastest way to share files, folders, and local apps.

        http <DIR> [subdomain]          serve a file, folder, or node express app
        ex: telebit http ~/Public pub   securely host ~/Public as pub.johndoe.telebit.io

        http <PORT> [subdomain]         forward all https traffic to a local app
        ex: telebit http 3000 app       publicize localhost:3000 as app.johndoe.telebit.io

        http none [subdomain]           remove secure http access for (any or all) subdomain(s)
        ex: telebit http none           remove all https access
"

tcp = "
usage: telebit tcp <path/port/none>

'telebit tcp' is provided for seemless connectivity to legacy apps

        tcp <local> [remote]          forward tcp to <local> from <remote>
        ex: telebit tcp 5050 6565     forward tcp port 6565 locally to port 5050

        tcp <path> [remote]           show ftp-style directory listing
        ex: telebit tcp ~/Public      show listing of ~/Public

        tcp none [remote]             disable tcp access for [remote] port
        ex: telebit tcp none 6565     remove access to port 6565

See also sclient <https://telebit.cloud/sclient> for connecting to legacy apps
with telebit-upscaled secure https access.
